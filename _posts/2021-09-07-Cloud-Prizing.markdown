# What is the cloud?
- The cloud or more specific *cloud computing* refers to the delivery of un-demand computing services over the internet on a pay as you go basis. Compared to a traditional hosting platform you only have to worry about your own application (or at least in the extent you prefer) and all other things like,maintenance of hardware, hosting platform and security (and more) is abstracted away.

# What are the pros and cons of cloud development
Well there are a lot of pros with cloud development:
- You don't have to take risks with investing upfront
- You don't need to worry about storage and maintenance of hardware
- The security aspect is outsourced by a (hopefully) trusted cloud provider with lots of experience.
- In case of data loss most cloud providers provide backup systems
- You have no problem with scalability, you don't have to buy additional hardware to deploy your app to a larger customer base.

# Cost of cloud hosting:

Provider | per month | per year
Microsoft Azure | $ 1,130 | $ 13,560
Amazon WS | $ 394 | $ 4,728
